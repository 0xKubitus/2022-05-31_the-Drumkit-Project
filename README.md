After a few days to discover and learn the basics of Javascript and manipulating DOM elements, I realized this Drumkit project:

When a user opens the app on their browser, they can play a specific instrument's sound when they press a specific key on their keyboard.
There is also an animation on the screen when a key is pressed, thanks to Javascript.
